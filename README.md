# Hebergement
## Dynamic Webpage with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
> The webpage has a title "page1" and links to a "style.css" stylesheet for the page's design. The webpage is in English and has a "viewport" set for responsive design on different devices. 
>The webpage has a header with a navigation bar that contains a "reflected" section with a link to "#" and text "MUNDO" and another section with text "MUNDO". The navigation bar also has a "dropdown" button labeled "LANGUES" that when clicked, displays a dropdown menu with links to "#" labeled "FRENCH", "SPANISH", and "ARABIC".
>The navigation bar also has two links labeled "SIGN UP" and "LOG IN" that when clicked, display modal window (pop-up) containing a form to sign up or log in. The sign up form has fields for name, cin, email, password and repeat password. The log in form has fields for email and password.
>The modals contain a form that upon submit, sends the data to "signup.php" and "login.php" respectively.
>ps: It should be noted that the code is not complete and that the forms are not connected to any server-side logic, so they will not work as intended. Also, it's not recommended to use onchange function since it's not supported on some browsers.
> A code for PHP script that handles the process of inserting data into a database when a user signs up on a website. It starts by defining the server details such as the server name, username, password, and the name of the database. Then, it establishes a connection to the database using the mysqli extension and checks if the signup button has been pressed. If it has, it assigns the values of the form fields to variables such as $NOM, $CIN, $EMAIL, and $PASSWORD. After that, it uses the query() method to insert these values into the 'CLIENT' table in the database, and it finally redirects the user to the index.html page.
>And a PHP script that handles the process of logging in to a website. It starts by defining the server details such as the server name, username, password, and the name of the database. Then, it establishes a connection to the database using the mysqli extension and starts a new session. After that, it checks if the login button has been pressed, and if it has, it assigns the values of the email and password fields to variables such as $EMAIL and $PASSWORD. Then it creates two SQL statements one for normal user and one for admin user and checks if the email and password entered match any in the 'CLIENT' table in the database. If they do, it sets session variables such as $_SESSION["name"] and $_SESSION["Id"] to the values of the corresponding columns in the table and redirects the user to the home.php page. If the user is admin then it redirects to admin page. If no match is found, it displays an error message saying that the username or password is incorrect.
